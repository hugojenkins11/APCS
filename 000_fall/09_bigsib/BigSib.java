/* Discoveries:
You must compile both files before you can run the code
<class>.<method> runs that method
This is a situation that you don't need a main method
QCC:
How would this work accessing a private class?
Does a method need a potential argument type?
e.g. "public static void main( String[] args )"
-we have no intention of using an argument
