Compile-Time Errors
- Indicate that something's wrong with the syntax
	- Tackle the first error first and one at a time
	- This may solve later errors as well
- Getting a weird compiler message
	- Look for hidden information
	- The message will tell you where the compiler was when it noticed the problem
- Common Syntax Errors: 
	1) Check that all parentheses and curly brackets are properly nested
	2) Check Capitalization
	3) Check for semicolons
	4) Check for double quotation marks around Strings
	5) Make sure all assignment statements are possible(the types match)
	6) Make sure all arguments are in the right order and of the right type
	7) Make sure the return type of each method matches what you are trying to do
	8) Make sure you are invoking methods on objects of the right type
	9) Inside and instance method, you can refer to the instance variables without specifying an object
- I can't get my code to compile
	0) Make a backup of the file you are working on
	1) Delete half the code
		1.0) Error remains: Delete another half of the code
		1.1) Error is resolved: Bring back half of the code
	2) Repeat
	- This works in other languages too
- I did what the compiler says but it doesn't work
	- Remedies that the compiler suggest are unreliable

Run-Time Errors
- Hanging Code
	- Code that is seemingly doing nothing
	- Often caught in an infinite loop or an infinite recursion
- Infinite Loop
	- Add print statements before and after each loop to see where you are getting stuck
	- Add print statements within the loop where you are getting stuck to see what you are getting stuck on
		- Print each variable and the loop's condition
- Infinite Recursion
	- Will cause a StackOverflowError
	- Make sure that there is a base case
	- Print parameters at each call
- Flow of Execution
	- Add print statements to the beginning of each method
	- Also print the arguments
	- One of the most common errors is providing arguments in the wrong order
- Exceptions:
	- NullPointerException
		- You tried to access an instance variable or invoke a method on an object that is currently null
	- StackOverflowError
		- Infinite recursion
	- ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
		- The index you are using to access an array is either negative or greater than array.length - 1
	- FileNotFoundException
		- Java didn't find the file
		- Check the location of the file and make sure it is accessible
	- ArithmeticException
		- Something went wrong with arithmetic
		- e.g. division by zero
- Try not to overflow the terminal with prints
	- Combine and comment out unnecessary ones

Logic Errors
- Program doesn't work
	- The compiler and interpreter don't know what the code is supposed to do so you must catch these errors yourself
	- Create a hypothesis about what the error is. To do so, ask yourself these questions:
		- Is there something the program is supposed to do that is not happening? 
		- Is something happening that shouldn't be? 
		- Is a section of code producing an unexpected effect? 
	- The problem might be more in your head that in the program
- Common Logic Errors: 
	1) Integer division round towards zero
	2) Floating-point numbers are approximate
	3) Make sure you are using "==" and the equals method in their appropriate contexts
	4) Inheritance can lead to subtle errors
- Expressions aren't returning what is expected
	- Simplify the code
		- This sometimes means lengthen
	- Check for order of operations
		- Use parentheses to force it
	- Use temporary values
- Print Statements
	- Use println instead of print
- You are really, really stuck
	- Computers can cause: 
		1) Frustration and rage
		2) Superstitious beliefs ans magical thinking
		3) Sour grapes
- Use peer review
	- Provide information on:
		1) The kind of bug
		2) The last thing you did before the bug
		3) The error message
		4) What you have tried and learned
- Use Rubber Ducking
	- Your ducky is your friend
