0) The base is a constant, x, that is multiplied by itself a certain number of times varying based on the value of its exponent. The exponent usually increases by increments of 1 starting at 0. So, a base 3 system would utilize 3 as the constant, x. The first place of the number(furthest to the right would be the 3^0 place, where each digit is worth 3^0, or 1. The second number would be the 3^1 place, where each digit is worth 3^1, or 3. There are x possible digits in a base-x number system. There would be 3 possible in a base-3 system, 0,1, and 2. 


1) Binary is a system of zeros and ones that represent numbers with a base 2 system. We care about this system because it is the simplest way to store information, and the only way that a computer can handle. There are only 2 states, with 1 representing "on'' and 0 "off." 


2) Binary to decimal 
Preset an int variable with a value of 0. Run through the binary number’s digits from left to right. If the digit is a 1, take 2^ (total # of digits in the array - the position of the digit from left to right, starting at 1). Add this number to the variable (the one initially set to 0). If the digit is a 0, add 0.


Example:
1001011
Total # of digits = 7
Variable = 0


1 → 2^(7-1) = 64                 [0+64=64]
0 → 0                                 [64+0=64]
0 → 0                                 [64+0=64]
1 → 2^(7-4) = 8                 [64+8=72]
0 → 0                                 [72+0=72]
1 → 2^(7-6) = 2                 [72+2=74]
1 → 2^(7-7) = 1                 [74+1=75]




3) Decimal to binary 
Store your decimal number. Find the remainder and quotient of the decimal when it is divided by 2 (ex: if the decimal is x, to find the remainder, find x%2). Add the remainder into an array and repeat the first step with the quotient as the decimal (or x). Reverse the order of the array. 


Example:
14/2=7 R0 
7/2= 3 R1
3/2= 1 R1
1/2 = 0 R1
Binary number is 1110




QCC/Notable things: 
- How do you convert one type of thing to another? E.g. int to string
- Not sure about terminology (ex: array, digit, position, index)
- What other uses of binary are there?
